At SwapLab, we believe in **Supply Chain Transparency**. The build engine used to process this template is based on our open-source core images. You can inspect the exact environment your code runs in:

* **🐳 Capacitor Core:** [View Public Base Image](https://github.com/swaplab-engine/capacitor-core)
* **🐳 Cordova Core:** [View Public Base Image](https://github.com/swaplab-engine/cordova-core)
* **📦 Build Packages:** [View Available Engine Images](https://github.com/orgs/swaplab-engine/packages)

Your project will be built using the publicly verifiable images listed above, ensuring no hidden dependencies or secret code injections in the runtime environment.
